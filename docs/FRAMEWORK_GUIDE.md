# Impact-First Framework Guide

## Introduction

The Impact-First framework, developed by Matt LeMay, helps product teams focus on work that delivers measurable business value. This guide explains the key principles and how to apply them.

## Core Problem

**Most organizations are set up to perpetuate low-impact work.**

- Low-impact work begets more low-impact work
- Teams do "work around the work" instead of contributing to impact
- Organizations see symptoms, not root causes
- "We can't just stop planned work to do something else" becomes the mantra

## Breaking the Death Spiral

### The Death Spiral Pattern

1. Team works on low-impact initiatives
2. These create dependencies and complexity
3. More teams needed to support the work
4. More coordination overhead
5. Even less high-impact work gets done
6. Repeat

### Solution: Focus on Fewer, More Impactful Goals

- If you must spend hours reviewing documentation to understand business expectations, you don't understand the goals
- Best practices are abstract at best without clear goals
- Goals should be no more than **1 step away** from critical business metrics

## The Five Dimensions

### 1. Business Impact & Goal Alignment (35%)

**The CEO Test**
> "If you were the CEO of the company, would you fully fund this team?"

This is the most critical question. If the answer is uncertain or no, the proposal needs rework.

**Key Questions:**
- Can you articulate clear business value?
- How does this connect to critical metrics? (Revenue, retention, growth)
- What market expectations or board commitments does this address?

**Red Flags:**
- Can't answer the value question clearly
- Multiple steps removed from business goals
- "Bedazzling" - visible work that doesn't improve core function

### 2. Quantifiable Impact (25%)

**The Four Questions:**

Every proposal must answer ALL four:

1. **How many people will this reach?**
   - Specific number required
   - Be realistic about addressable audience

2. **What action do we want them to take?**
   - Clear, specific action
   - Not vague ("engage more")

3. **What's the value of that action?**
   - Dollar value per action
   - Tied to business metrics

4. **What's the likelihood they'll complete it?**
   - Percentage probability
   - Based on data/research when possible

**Expected Impact Calculation:**
```
Expected Impact = Reach × Action Value × (Conversion Likelihood / 100)
```

Example:
- Reach: 10,000 users
- Action: Upgrade to premium
- Value: $50/month
- Likelihood: 15%
- Expected Impact: 10,000 × $50 × 0.15 = $75,000/month

### 3. Focus Over Process Theatre (20%)

**What is Process Theatre?**
- Following frameworks/best practices without delivering value
- Heavy documentation without clear outcomes
- OKRs that don't drive actual impact
- Meetings about alignment instead of doing work

**How to Avoid It:**
- Focus on tangible business outcomes
- Simplify rather than complicate
- Minimize new dependencies
- Deliver value, not process compliance

**Example - Bad (Process Theatre):**
> "Implement new OKR framework to align teams on customer engagement metrics using industry best practices"

**Example - Good (Outcome Focus):**
> "Increase customer retention by 10% by fixing top 3 churn drivers identified in exit surveys"

### 4. Death Spiral Avoidance (15%)

**Warning Signs:**
- Creates downstream "support work"
- Increases product complexity
- Requires hours of documentation to understand
- Adds dependencies between teams
- "We'll need to..." appears frequently

**Good Signs:**
- Simplifies existing product
- Reduces dependencies
- Goals clearly stated without docs
- Team willing to pivot if better path found

### 5. Commercial Mindedness (5%)

**The Mindset:**
> "I'm doing the best I can within my operating/business model to help the company win."

**Key Elements:**
- Clear cost-benefit analysis
- Honest discussion of tradeoffs
- Understanding of business model fit
- Grounded in fundamentals (costs, benefits, competitive position)

## Applying the Framework

### Before Starting Work

1. **Apply the CEO Test**
   - Would you fund this with your own money?
   - Can you clearly articulate the ROI?

2. **Answer the Four Questions**
   - All four, with specific numbers
   - Calculate expected impact

3. **Check for Death Spiral Risks**
   - Does this simplify or complicate?
   - What downstream work does it create?

### When Goals Aren't Clear

Ask:
- What does the market want to see from this company?
- What expectations/promises were made to the board?
- What are our critical success metrics?

### In AI/Transformation Contexts

- Quantify the value of your solutions
- Stay close to fundamentals
- Keep discussions grounded in costs, benefits, tradeoffs
- The more you can quantify value, the safer you'll be

## Common Mistakes

### "Bedazzling the Car"

**Scenario:** Product team faces choice:
- Option 1: Fix core engine (risky, hard to see, might break things)
- Option 2: Add shiny features (visible, safe, not your fault if engine breaks)

**Problem:** Bedazzling is visible but doesn't achieve the goal. May even hinder core function.

**Solution:** Do the hard work on the core, not the safe work on the periphery.

### "We Don't Have Role Clarity"

This usually means: **We don't understand our goal.**

When aligned on goals, people figure out roles. Role confusion is a symptom of goal confusion.

### Over-Reliance on Frameworks

Frameworks (OKRs, bets, KPI trees) are tools, not outcomes. They should help you deliver impact, not become the work itself.

## Success Indicators

You're doing well when:
- You can answer the value question in 30 seconds
- Goals are 1 step from critical metrics
- Team doesn't need docs to explain goals
- Work simplifies rather than complicates
- Downstream dependencies are minimal
- CEO would fund your work

You're in trouble when:
- Can't clearly articulate business value
- Need hours to understand alignment
- Creating "work around the work"
- Adding complexity and dependencies
- Following process without questioning impact

## Remember

> "Business expects some kind of return on investment from your team. If you can't answer the question about the value you're bringing, you're in trouble."

The most commercially minded PMs are the happiest. Focus on impact first.
